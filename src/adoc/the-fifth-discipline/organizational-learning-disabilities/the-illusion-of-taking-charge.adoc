We want to avoid reacting to events. Instead, we want to mitigate problems before they grow complex or costly. If we find and address such problems before they grow too large to manage, so the thinking goes, we can avoid most major problems. Thus, we try to act "proactively." Frequently, however, our proactive decisions are merely reactions to <<The enemy is out there, the enemy out there>>. That is, we try to "get them" before they "get us."

To be truly proactive requires we understand how we contribute to our own problems, and make decisions based on that understanding.
