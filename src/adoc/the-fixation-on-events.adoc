= The fixation on events
Page 21

We wrongly seek to explain our reality as a series of cause-and-effect events, and we focus on the short-term. As a consequence, we fail to identify larger patterns that goven these events which could otherwise grant us generative power.

While trapped in this narrow point of view, the best we can do is react optimally to events as they come. We may succumb to <<the-illusion-of-taking-charge#the-illusion-of-taking-charge,the illusion of taking charge>>, and without an understanding of the larger patterns at work, make ineffective attempts to address oncoming events. All the while, the underlying pattern may be slowly bringing about our doom, but from our limited vantage point, we cannot recognize our case of <<the-boiled-frog#the-boiled-frog,the boiled frog>>.
